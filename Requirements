Project Requirements 
    Application must run on Android system.
    Application will work without internet access. 
    Must have a reminder feature.
        Reminders must be able to added and deleted 
        Must have a “time due” feature.
        Must have a priority system per reminder.
        
    Alert the user about reminder through notification.
        Must have different “levels” of reminders, based on priority level
        
    Display the current reminders on home screen. 
    
    Must not take more than a minute to add a reminder.
        Under 30 seconds would be preferable.
        Would be a good idea to run a time analysis of this app versus other “calendar apps”, 
          and statistically graph how much time is saved using our app than say, Google Calendars, etc.
          
    Must be easy to use
        Perhaps a field test - invite people who have never used the app to try it out, if they have 
          any kind of questions, fix them. If they can’t find something in app, fix it. Users should 
          be able to easily grasp it without much effort.
        
    The application should automatically ask users if they want to be re-reminded of a past notification.
    
    Past notifications should go into a “history” queue.
        Perhaps a max of 100 notifications? 128? 255?
        
    
    Must implement a "time until next notification" clock / timer
    
    Implement some sort of a stopwatch / countdown timer
    
    Must be able to give alarms even if application is not open
